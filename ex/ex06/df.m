% function to search for a path from the start to the target position
% start:    start position (y, x) / (row, col)
% target:   target position (y, x) / (row, col)
% mat:      maze structure
% heu:      type of heuristic
%               'y': reduce first in y direction
%               'x': reduce first in x direction
%               'l': reduce first the longer distance
%               's': reduce first the shorter distance
% h:        figure reference. If omitted, de figure is not updated (optional)
% return:   mat:        updated maze structure, including the path (0.1 for each
%                       passage)
%           step_count: number of steps necessary to reach the target (inf if it
%                       is not possible to reach the target)
%           path:       the direct path (without backtracking) from the start
%                       position to the target position
%           path_tot:   the complete path (including backtracking) from the
